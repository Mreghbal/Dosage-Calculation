# Dosage-Calculation
An example of Python code for dosage calculation that takes into account various parameters such as patient weight, age, desired concentration, body surface area (BSA), and creatinine clearance.
In this code, the "calculate_dosage" function takes the patient's weight, age, desired concentration, BSA, and creatinine clearance as input parameters and performs the dosage calculation based on these values. It considers different conditions such as age and renal function to adjust the dosage accordingly.

You can run this code in a Python environment and provide the required inputs to calculate the dosage. Please note that this is a simplified example, and actual dosage calculations involve additional considerations and formulas specific to medications and medical practices.
